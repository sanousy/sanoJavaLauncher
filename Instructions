if you need to simply use the application, you need only to download the dist folder contents, and make a shortcut to run it :)

a short cut must be mainly to java.exe not to the "sanoJavaLauncher.jar", but it should run it as per the below example:
(this is inside the shortcut itshelf in Target field in the shortcut properties dialog box):

E:\jdk-14.0.1\bin\javaw.exe -jar C:\Users\User\sanoJavaLauncher\dist\sanoJavaLauncher.jar

for sure this applies to my machine setup for you assuming that your java runtime foler in c:\program files\java\bin
and assuming that you saved only dist folder to C:\ (i.e. c:\dist)

all what you need to do is to change the target of your shortcut to become:
c:\program files\java\bin\java.exe -jar c:\dist\sanoJavaLauncher.jar

Please tell me if you enjoyed this product, it is free, and guaranteed to be free forever (as I am alive at least) :)


Limitations:
Some limitations you might face on linux, because Java for linux does not support trasparency,
so, you might see a small square at the top right corner of the screen, other than that it is expected to be fine.

Please note that RSML file is saved on linux on your home folder (automatically detected), but if you have already your ownn links.rsml file
you might copy and replace the automatic copy which is being created by the application if this file was not found on your home folder (same on windows).

to be honest, I did not test it on Mac, because I have no Mac, so, if anyone helps me to check it on Mac, I would appreciate so much (may be Macs already have their 
own beautiful launcher, but still maybe someone would like to use it there, because it is a different concept).


Please share your opinion, and your enhancements ideas if any, it will be my pleasure to provide such a service to humanity, where I believe not everything is for money! 
several things should be based on unconditional giving.

Sincerely, 
Sanousy.
