a cute eyecandy applications/links/folders launcher

Actually I was looking for a small footprint launcher for my desktop, that I can use, without a lot of cosmetic options, no such sooo flexible things drag drop vanish, multiprofile.

I am a linux guy, I like neat/clean/compact applications that do what is exactly required to do, no more visual effects, find things where I left them.

Desktop is always full of non-desired icons, you cannot decide which one to keep and which one to remove, so, I thought it would be nice if I have a specific list of icons, those I am using everyday, and they must be in groups...

it must also, be able to hide when I don't need it.

No more system icons, only text and "Type Icon" ( i.e. web locatio, application, folder on the system) and thats it.

If you think like me ... and need more practical way to handle things, then you might like my application, I wrote for myself first, and then I thoght maybe someone like me wants this way of practical launcher, so, I decided to share it with community for free, it is safe ... where you place things you will not lose them by any way, unless you go back and delete them by hand one by one ... it is rock solid links to your favourite locations all over the web/local device in the same time.


this version is running fine on Windows, and I am working on my Raspberry Pi 3 Scratch operating system to make it work on linux as well.


Thanks for using my application, I am not asking for appreciation/price/or any type of rewards, it is just for everyone with alot of love.

Sano.
